Hello, everyone! I'm Joshua, a third-year Systems Engineering student at the National University of Costa Rica. I’m passionate about artificial intelligence, web development, and continuous learning. I love exploring new technologies and building projects that make a positive impact.

What I’m up to
- 🧐 I'm interested in AI, machine learning, and cloud technologies.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Web Development, Networks, Data Bases and Operative Systems.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to AI or web dev.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with real-world AI implementations and best practices.
- 💬 Ask me about Java, Docker, or any challenges you’re facing in APIs!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also love playing guitar and exploring music in my free time.
- 🎸 Here's a pic!
